## Project Overview
The **Climate Change Dashboard** is a Python-based project that analyzes global temperature anomalies and visualizes their trends and regional impacts. It highlights the effect of climate change through statistical analysis and interactive visualizations, enabling better understanding and awareness of global warming.

## Project Objectives
1. Analyze global temperature anomalies over time.
2. Visualize temperature trends and their distribution.
3. Highlight the impacts of climate change on specific regions.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Data Source
The dataset is a sample representing global temperature anomalies, inspired by publicly available climate datasets:
- [NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
- [NOAA Global Temperature Data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/global-temperature-anomalies)
